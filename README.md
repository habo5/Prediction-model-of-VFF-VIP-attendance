# Prediction-model-of-VFF-VIP-attendance

This project focuses on improving the Danish football club Viborg FF's utilization of data to optimize the engagement and attendance rates among VIP guests. The project employs a combination of machine learning and data analysis methods to identify key factors influencing guests participation and engagement. It is based on data from Superstats.dk, DMI.dk, and empirical data from Viborg FF.

The project involves the application of Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Best Subset Selection to develop and evaluate predictive models. These models are assessed in terms of accuracy (MSE and RMSE) and explanatory power (RÂ²),  to ensure robustness and generalizability. 
The project has as a main goal to offer insights on how Viborg FF can maximize the attendance and engagement of their VIP guests, thereby creating significant value for their commercial department.
